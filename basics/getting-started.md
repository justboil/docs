# Getting Started

## Pre-requisites

A build setup allows us to use Vue [Single-File Components](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/sfc) (SFCs). The official Vue build setup is based on [Vite](https://vitejs.dev), a frontend build tool that is modern, lightweight and extremely fast.

:::tip Pre-requisites

- Familiarity with the command line
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Linting

Uses official ESLint plugin for Vue.js.

This plugin allows us to check the `<template>` and `<script>` of `.vue` files with ESLint, as well as Vue code in `.js` files.

- Finds syntax errors.
- Finds the wrong use of [Vue.js Directives](https://vuejs.org/api/built-in-directives.html).
- Finds the violation for [Vue.js Style Guide](https://vuejs.org/style-guide/).

ESLint editor integrations are useful to check your code in real-time.

### Lint command

```
npm run lint
```
